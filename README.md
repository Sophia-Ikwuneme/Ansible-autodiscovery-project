This Java enterprise project is designed to operate within a highly available and scalable AWS infrastructure. At its core, the project leverages Bash scripting as a crucial tool for seamlessly incorporating private IP addresses into our Ansible inventory file. This dynamic process ensures the automatic inclusion of newly provisioned instances from our Auto Scaling Group.

Aligned with contemporary DevOps best practices, the project places a strong emphasis on automation, scalability, high availability, and resilience. It facilitates collaborative management, allowing both developers and operators to streamline and enhance the entire lifecycle of the Java application. From the initial development phase to deployment, the project harnesses the robust capabilities of AWS infrastructure.

The architectural diagram below provides a detailed breakdown of the project's structure, highlighting its intricate components and how they interact within the AWS environment.
